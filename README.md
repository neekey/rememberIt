## HOW IT WORKS

RememberIt helps you memorize things by reminding you about them repeatedly based on the famous Forgetting-Curve Theory made by Hermann Ebbinghaus. Once you have told RememberIt what you want to remember, It will create several memory tasks for you one after one to make sure you memorize things well and hard to forget.

## HOW TO USE

1. You need to login to todoist to authorize RememberIt the permission of creating tasks. Once it is done, RememberIt will add a label named "Remember_It" and a project named "Things To Remember" to your Todoist account automatically. 
2. Whenever you want to remember anything, just add a task to describe it and label it with "Remember_It‚Äù. This task is what is called Original Memory Task. Notice that whatever task you add to project "Things to Remember" will be ignored. 
3. After you have created your Original Memory Task, the subsequent memory tasks will be added to project "Things To Remember" with certain dates, they are intended to remind you repeatedly and their names will be marked with your memory process, eg "mom's birthday is 1960-01-10 [17%]. 
4. Whenever you complete a subsequent task, another subsequent task will be created according to the current memory process. If a subsequent task marked with '100%' is completed, the whole memory process will be finished, and the Original Memory Task will be closed automatically. If you manually complete the Original Memory Task, the whole memory process will be finished, and the current subsequent task will be completed. 
5. Notice: due to the possible delay of Todoist webhook calls, any changes described above may take minutes to process.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If you delete the automatically created project or label by mistake, you can reinitialize them.
